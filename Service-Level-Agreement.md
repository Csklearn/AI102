Defects
-------

We are committed to triaging and responding to reported defects such as bugs, accessibility issues, and documentation errors **within 2 business days**.

If we need more information to understand and identify the issue, then we will seek it from the reporter. Otherwise, we will respond to the reporter with a plan and a timeline for the fix.

If a defect is thought to be critical, then it should be raised to the **RDS Product Owner**, who will determine the criticality and help expedite if needed.

Design Updates & Feature Requests

Requests for style changes and features including new components are handled and considered on a case-by-case basis. Changes related to the design or the experience should be submitted by a member of the Experience Design team.

Escalation Process
==================

If SLA targets are not met, escalate to the **RDS Product Owner** or whoever is covering in the absence of the PO. Any available RDS team member can assist you with reaching the acting PO.
